function M = fixedrankfactory(m, n, k)
% A set whose element is a m by n matrix with fixed rank k. This is first
% given by Vandereycken in his paper "Low-rank matrix completion by 
% Riemannian optimization, SIAM J. Optim., 23(2), 1214–1236." 
%
% X is represented by a structure, m by k matrix U, n by k matrix V, k by k
% diagonal matrix S, which are the SVD of X, i.e., X = U*S*V'.
%
% Tangent vectors at X is also represented with a similar structure: m by k
% matrix Up, k by k matrix M and n by k matrix Vp such that Up'*U = 0 and
% Vp'*V = 0. Its corresponding matrix representation is 
%    Z = U*M*V' + Up*V' + U*Vp'.

% Change log: 
%
%	Feb. 20, 2014 (NB):
%       Added function tangent to work with checkgradient.
%
%   June 24, 2014 (NB):
%       A couple modifications following
%       Bart Vandereycken's feedback:
%       - The checksum (hash) was replaced for a faster alternative: it's a
%         bit less "safe" in that collisions could arise with higher
%         probability, but they're still very unlikely.
%       - The vector transport was changed.
%       The typical distance was also modified, hopefully giving the
%       trustregions method a better initial guess for the trust region
%       radius, but that should be tested for different cost functions too.
%
%    July 11, 2014 (NB):
%       Added ehess2rhess and tangent2ambient, supplied by Bart.
%
%    July 14, 2014 (NB):
%       Added vec, mat and vecmatareisometries so that hessianspectrum now
%       works with this geometry. Implemented the tangent function.
%       Made it clearer in the code and in the documentation in what format
%       ambient vectors may be supplied, and generalized some functions so
%       that they should now work with both accepted formats.
%       It is now clearly stated that for a point X represented as a
%       triplet (U, S, V), the matrix S needs to be diagonal.
